    <h1>Service Policy</h1>
    
    <h2>Eligibility</h2>
    <p>Anyone can access and use our exchange service without restrictions. We do not impose discriminatory criteria or rejection policies.</p>
    
    <h2>Rates and Fees</h2>
    <p>Our exchange operates on a dynamic rate system, continuously updating based on cryptocurrency market fluctuations. Once a payment is received, the rate is locked for 45 minutes. If no payment is detected within this period, the rate will update every 45 minutes until payment is made.</p>
    
    <h2>Customer Payments</h2>
    <p>There are no minimum or maximum amount restrictions for sending payments. However, if a customer sends an amount exceeding our conversion balance limits, they will be automatically refunded. Minimum and maximum balance limits are displayed before creating an order.</p>
    
    <h2>Our Payments</h2>
    <p>We process payments to customers once their transaction has received sufficient blockchain confirmations and is within our operational balance limits. These limits are disclosed to users before initiating a transaction.</p>
    
    <h2>Refunds</h2>
    <p>All refund operations are fully automated and incur no additional fees.</p>
    
    <h2>Support</h2>
    <p>Users can contact support via the Telegram link on our website. Each order also includes a dedicated support chat, allowing users to receive transaction-specific assistance. Response times depend on current workload but will not exceed 12 hours.</p>
    
    <h2>Prohibited Jurisdictions</h2>
    <p>None. Our system does not log IP addresses or track customer locations, ensuring full anonymity.</p>
    
    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We do not collect or store customer metadata. IP logging is disabled across all service endpoints, including reverse proxies, caching servers, and backend systems. Exchange-related transaction data is deleted immediately after completion, making it irretrievable.</p>
    
    <h2>Cookies and Tracking</h2>
    <p>Our website does not use cookies or tracking technologies.</p>
