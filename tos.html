      <section class="tos-section">
        <h2>Eligibility</h2>
        <p>Our service is open to everyone—there are no restrictions or discrimination in who can create and perform exchange operations.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="tos-section">
        <h2>Rates & Fees</h2>
        <p>We operate on a dynamic rate model, meaning exchange rates adjust in real-time based on cryptocurrency market fluctuations. Rates are locked for 45 minutes once an order is created. If no payment is received within this timeframe, the rate will update every subsequent 45-minute interval until a payment is made.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="tos-section">
        <h2>Customer Payments</h2>
        <p>There are no minimum or maximum limits on how much customers can send. However, if a sent amount exceeds our system’s convertible balance, the transaction will be automatically refunded. Customers are informed of these min/max limits before creating an order and throughout the exchange process.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="tos-section">
        <h2>Our Payments</h2>
        <p>We process payouts once the incoming transaction receives sufficient network confirmations and does not exceed our convertible balance. Min/max balance limits are clearly displayed before order creation and during the exchange.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="tos-section">
        <h2>Refunds</h2>
        <p>All refunds are fully automated, and no additional fees are applied.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="tos-section">
        <h2>Support</h2>
        <p>For assistance, customers can create a support ticket via the Telegram contact link on our website. Additionally, each exchange order includes a dedicated support chat, where users can get real-time updates related to their specific transaction. Response times depend on demand but should not exceed 12 hours.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="tos-section">
        <h2>Prohibited Jurisdictions</h2>
        <p>None. We do not track or log customer locations. IP logging is disabled, and our systems do not process or store such data.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="tos-section">
        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We prioritize absolute privacy:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>No metadata collection – We do not store any identifiable user data.</li>
          <li>No IP logging – Disabled across reverse proxies, caching servers, and backend API servers.</li>
          <li>Exchange data deletion – Once a transaction is completed, all related data (such as sending/receiving addresses) is permanently deleted from our system, making it unrecoverable.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Our website does not use cookies or any tracking mechanisms.</p>
