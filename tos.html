    <h1>Service Policy</h1>
    <h2>Eligibility</h2>
    <p>Our service is open to everyone. We impose no restrictions or discriminatory practices when it comes to performing exchange operations.</p>

    <h2>Rates and Fees</h2>
    <p>We operate on a dynamic rate system, meaning exchange rates are continuously updated based on real-time cryptocurrency market fluctuations. Once a payment is received, the rate is fixed. Orders maintain their fixed rate for 45 minutes. If no payment is detected within this timeframe, the rate updates for another 45-minute cycle.</p>

    <h2>Customer Payments</h2>
    <p>There are no minimum or maximum limits for sending funds. However, if a user sends an amount exceeding our conversion capacity, an automatic refund is issued. Users are informed of minimum and maximum limits before initiating an exchange.</p>

    <h2>Our Payments</h2>
    <p>Payments to customers are executed once the received amount meets the necessary blockchain confirmations and stays within our conversion capacity. As with customer payments, users are notified of these limits before proceeding with an exchange.</p>

    <h2>Refunds</h2>
    <p>Refunds are fully automated, and we impose no fees on refund transactions.</p>

    <h2>Support</h2>
    <p>For assistance, customers can reach support via the Telegram contact link on our website. Each exchange also includes a dedicated order-specific support chat. Response times depend on current workload but should not exceed 12 hours.</p>

    <h2>Prohibited Jurisdictions</h2>
    <p>There are no country restrictions. Our system does not log IP addresses or process location data, ensuring full anonymity.</p>

    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We uphold strict privacy standards. No customer metadata is collected, and IP logging is disabled across all system components, including reverse proxies, caching servers, and backend services. Exchange-related details, such as transaction addresses, are permanently deleted upon transaction completion, making them unrecoverable.</p>

    <h2>Cookies and Tracking</h2>
    <p>Our website does not use cookies or any form of tracking technology.</p>
