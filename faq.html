        <div class="faq-item">
          <h2>Why is my Bitcoin transaction taking longer than expected?</h2>
          <p>Bitcoin transactions depend on network congestion and mining fees. If there are many unconfirmed transactions in the mempool, confirmations can take longer. Transactions with higher fees are prioritized by miners, while lower-fee transactions may take longer.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h2>Why is my Monero exchange delayed?</h2>
          <p>Monero transactions require 10 confirmations before funds become fully spendable. If there are multiple pending transactions, delays may occur, but your exchange will be processed as soon as the confirmations are completed.</p>
